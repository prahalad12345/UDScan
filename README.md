## Glossary
| Term      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| OCR(Optical Character Recognition      | It is a technology that recognizes text within a digital image. Target typewritten text, only Glyph or character at a time. |
| OWR(Optical word Reconition)           | Target typewritten text, only word at a time.|
| ICR(Intelligent Character Recognition) | Target typewritten printed script or cursive text one glyph or character at a time. Usually involves machine learning.|
| IWR(Intelligent Word Recognition)      | Target typewritten printed script or cursive text word at a time. This is especially useful for language where glyphs are not separated in cursive script |


## Problem solved by UScan
* UDScan is a framework used for digitizing printed text so that it can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed online and used in machine processes such as Machine learning, Text to Speech and Text Mining .

* Converts an unscanned image, pdf or video into text format
